# BackendChallenge

A simple checkout system that calculates the cost of a basket and applies any special discounts or pricing rules which are required for that order.

#Installation Instructions

You will require Python 3.8 installed to use this program.

#Usage Instructions

-To build a basket, create item objects representing each item product in the basket
-Store these items to be used later by the system
-You will then need to build any pricing rules you want to apply
-To initialize the system just run the scanner.py and introduce the item code of each product in the basket and then No, this will return the total purchase price with the princing rules applied

#Future Improvements

-Right now products are being represented as an array of items. In a more efficient system with more data  would be held as a table in a database and accessed that way.
